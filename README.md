Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator
Description:

This is a simple CPU scheduling simulator that supports four different scheduling algorithms:
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Priority Scheduling

The program takes user-defined processes with arrival times, burst times, and priorities, then simulates the selected algorithm, displaying a text-based Gantt chart and calculating key performance metrics like:
Average Waiting Time
Average Turnaround Time
Features

Simulates multiple CPU scheduling algorithms.
Accepts user input for scheduling choice and Round Robin quantum time.
Displays a simple Gantt chart in text format.
Calculates and prints scheduling performance metrics.

Installation & Usage
Requirements
Python 3.x
Running the Simulator
Clone the repository or download the script.
Open a terminal and navigate to the script directory.

Run the following command:

python cpu_scheduler_simulator.py
Choose a scheduling algorithm from the menu.
If Round Robin is selected, enter the time quantum.
View the text-based Gantt chart and performance metrics.
